    "<p>In SQLAlchemy, the <b>Engine</b> is the most fundamental object. It's your starting point and the core of all database interactions. Think of it as the <i>gateway</i> or factory that manages everything about how your Python program connects to your PostgreSQL database.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Analogy:</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "If your PostgreSQL database is a powerful car, the Engine is the <b>key, ignition system, and fuel line</b> all in one.  \n",
    "You don't drive the car by directly manipulating the engine parts; you use the key to start it, and then the car's internal systems (managed by the Engine object) handle the rest.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>What the Engine Actually Does:</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><b>Connection Pooling:</b>  \n",
    "    Creating a new connection to the database is slow and expensive.  \n",
    "    The Engine manages a pool of connections. When your code asks for a connection, it hands you one from the pool.  \n",
    "    When you're done, the connection is returned to the pool (not closed), so it can be reused instantly.  \n",
    "    This is much faster than opening and closing new connections repeatedly.\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><b>Database Dialect Handling:</b>  \n",
    "    The Engine knows the specific <i>dialect</i> of your database (PostgreSQL in this case).  \n",
    "    It translates SQLAlchemy Core expressions into the exact SQL syntax PostgreSQL understands.\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><b>DBAPI Bridge:</b>  \n",
    "    The Engine uses the installed DBAPI driver (like <code>psycopg2</code>) under the hood to handle the low-level communication with the database.  \n",
    "    You don't have to worry about it‚Äîthe Engine manages everything.\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Important:</b> Creating an Engine object does not immediately connect to the database.  \n",

    "<p>In the SQLAlchemy ORM, the <strong>Declarative Base</strong> is the foundation upon which all your data models are built. Think of it as the \"DNA\" or \"template\" that all your table-mapping classes will inherit from.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>How It Works</h3>\n",
    "<p>When using the ORM approach, instead of defining tables directly (as in SQLAlchemy Core), you create Python classes. Each class:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Represents a table</strong> in your database.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Each attribute</strong> of the class represents a column in that table.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Each instance</strong> of the class represents a row in that table.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The Declarative Base makes this possible. It is a factory function that returns a base class, and your custom classes inherit from it. This base class:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Maintains a catalog of all the classes and tables you define.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Knows how to map them to the database.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Why is Declarative Base Powerful?</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Clean and Pythonic:</strong> Your database schema is defined using pure Python classes, natural for Python developers.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Automation:</strong> It automatically sets up the mapping between your class and the database table.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> All your model classes follow the same structure, making the codebase easier to maintain.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>ORM Features:</strong> You gain access to sessions, relationships, and queries that feel like Python code.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
